# monte-carlo-simulation-of-physical-vapour-desposition
A modelling project using Monte Carlo methods to model the deposition of physical particles onto a surface (the surface is assume to be one layer thick).

This project looks to model the growth of a thin film deposited by physical vapor desposition. The behviour of the particles, governed by thermodynamics is modelled using a Metropolis Monte Carlo algorithm to assess the impact of pressure, bonding energies and charge polarity on the overall coverage of a surface.
